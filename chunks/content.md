## These days I specialise in front end observability. Most of my projects and projects I contribute to are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/omrilotan) and are available as open-source. I write articles about coding on ~[Medium](https://medium.com/@omrilotan)~ [DEV Community](https://dev.to/omrilotan).

At the moment I'm working on [doowat](https://doowat.net). It's a web app for "on the go" activities to do with your child that require no preparations. If you have small kids - I encourage you to check it out. It's open source and has no profit angle - just fun.

I take great pleasure in [contributing to open source projects](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aomrilotan+-user%3Aomrilotan+-user%3Afiverr&type=Issues). By the third time I have to repeat a task - it will already have been semi or fully automated. I create simple tools to help me [work faster and more efficiently](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=productivity+user%3Aomrilotan&type=Repositories) and they are usually released as open source software. I've created lots of tools to add observability to node services with [route timers](https://github.com/omrilotan/routes/tree/master/packages/time#readme), [monitoring](https://github.com/fiverr/node-statsd-client), [managing concurrent connections](https://github.com/omrilotan/graceful-shutdown), as well as [measuring front end pages](https://github.com/fiverr/page-timing). You could find some useful helpers and tools in a mono-repo dedicated to small NPM packages and development tools: [🚝 mono](https://omrilotan.com/mono/) &mdash; Check it out. [ci-cd.net](https://ci-cd.net/) is a hosted collection of generic helper shell scripts, which aim to streamline continues integration and delivery processes across services.

Short articles I've written include 💂‍ Front end observability. [A practical guide to browser error monitoring](https://dev.to/omrilotan/front-end-observability-a-practical-guide-to-browser-error-monitoring-2gcm). ✏️ An illustrated [guide to SemVer (Semantic Versioning)](https://dev.to/omrilotan/major-minor-patch-5a7h) 🤺. A walk-through for using [git submodules](https://dev.to/omrilotan/working-with-git-submodules-2nc2) as a tool for code re-use 🐙. An example of how to [automate documentation websites](https://dev.to/omrilotan/robots-writing-docs-3o79) creation 🤖. And [more](https://dev.to/omrilotan).

I'm also maintaining a couple of mostly useless web pages: [Black](https://omrilotan.com/black/) is just a black page with full-screen toggle we use on our TV at home to black out the screen 🖥. A simple page that tells the [time](https://omrilotan.com/time/) 🕰. See current stage of the [moon](https://omrilotan.com/moon/) 🌕. [PWD](https://omrilotan.com/pwd/) is a consistent password generator 🔑. A [simple typing game](https://omrilotan.com/reprint/) I used to teach my kids what is a keyboard.
