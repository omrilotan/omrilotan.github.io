## Most of my projects and projects I contribute to are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/omrilotan) and are available as open-source. I write articles about coding on [Medium](https://medium.com/@omrilotan).

I maintain several nodejs packages and npm based CLI tools in one repo: [mono](https://omrilotan.com/mono/). Check it out, it's got some useful helpers and tools. &para; I'm using [dont-look-up](https://fiverr.github.io/dont_look_up_package/) to verify encapsulation in the mono repo eco-system. &para; [ci-cd.net](https://ci-cd.net/) is a hosted collection of generic helper shell scripts, which aim to streamline continues integration and delivery processes across services. This project's goal is to include non business logic scripts which can be used out-of-the-box or adapted by arguments. &para; I created [Published](https://published.js.org/) to be compatible an opinionated NPM publishing tool especially for CI-CD work-flows â€” It decides if and how to publish packages to NPM.

Short articles I've written include &para; An illustrated [guide to SemVer (Semantic Versioning)](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/major-minor-patch-a5298e2e1798). &para; A walk-through for using [git submodules](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/working-with-git-submodules-ec6210801e07) as a tool for code re-use. &para; An example of how to [automate documentation websites](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/robots-writing-docs-3b9877e42c31) creation. &para; And [more](https://medium.com/@omrilotan/latest).
