## Most of my projects and projects I contribute to are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/omrilotan) and are available as open-source. I write articles about coding on [Medium](https://medium.com/@omrilotan).

I maintain several nodejs packages and npm based CLI tools in one repo: [mono](https://omrilotan.com/mono/). Check it out, it's got some useful helpers and tools 🚝. Another collection specifying in expressjs middleware and http helpers is [routes](https://www.npmjs.com/org/routes), which I find useful for web services 🛤. I'm using [dont-look-up](https://fiverr.github.io/dont_look_up_package/) to verify encapsulation in the mono repo eco-system 🙈. [ci-cd.net](https://ci-cd.net/) is a hosted collection of generic helper shell scripts, which aim to streamline continues integration and delivery processes across services. This project's goal is to include non business logic scripts which can be used out-of-the-box or adapted by arguments ⛓. I created [Published](https://published.js.org/) to be compatible an opinionated NPM publishing tool especially for CI-CD work-flows — It decides if and how to publish packages to NPM.

Short articles I've written include ✏️ An illustrated [guide to SemVer (Semantic Versioning)](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/major-minor-patch-a5298e2e1798) 🤺. A walk-through for using [git submodules](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/working-with-git-submodules-ec6210801e07) as a tool for code re-use 🐙. An example of how to [automate documentation websites](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/robots-writing-docs-3b9877e42c31) creation 🤖. And [more](https://medium.com/@omrilotan/latest) 𝐌.

I'm also maintaining a couple of mostly useless web pages: [PWD](https://omrilotan.com/pwd/) is a consistent password generator 🔑. [Black](https://omrilotan.com/black/) is just a black page with full-screen toggle we use on our TV at home to black out the screen 🖥. A simple page that tells the [time](https://omrilotan.com/time/) 🕰. See current stage of the [moon](https://omrilotan.com/moon/) 🌕.
