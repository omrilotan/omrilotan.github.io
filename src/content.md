## I specialise in front end observability. I [code](https://github.com/omrilotan), [write](https://medium.com/@omrilotan), [contribute](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aomrilotan+-user%3Aomrilotan+-user%3Afiverr&type=Issues) open source software. I like [productivity tools](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=productivity+user%3Aomrilotan&type=Repositories).

I maintain open source projects including [a web app](https://doowat.net) with fun time fillers for me and my kids, A [crawler recogniser](https://isbot.js.org), A feature packed [StatsD client](https://opensource.fiverr.com/node-statsd-client/#/), A package to measure and collect [browser performance metrics](https://github.com/fiverr/page-timing#readme), Nodejs application [shutdown management](https://github.com/omrilotan/graceful-shutdown). I've written short articles about [Front end observability](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/front-end-observability-a-practical-guide-to-browsers-error-monitoring-with-window-onerror-307f7a93deef), [SemVer](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/major-minor-patch-a5298e2e1798), [git submodules](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/working-with-git-submodules-ec6210801e07), [documentation automation](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/robots-writing-docs-3b9877e42c31). I've created some useless web pages: [A black page](https://omrilotan.com/black/) for our TV at home. A [clock](https://omrilotan.com/time/). Current stage of the [moon](https://omrilotan.com/moon/). [A consistent password generator](https://omrilotan.com/pwd/). A [simple typing game](https://omrilotan.com/reprint/). I do other stuff, too.
